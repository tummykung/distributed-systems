Overall experience
==================
This homework is similar to the previous homework, so it was easier
to get through everything. I got stuck on this issue

https://moodle.cs.hmc.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=154

and didn't have much time to checkout lab Macs (even through ssh).

Java experience
===============
Java is nice. RMI takes care of almost everything. At first, I did
not know how to put everything together, but examples from class 
helped a lot. The fact that there is no easy way to start epmd through
Java is unfortunate.

Erlang experience
=================
Erlang is a little unusual in that it has to do epmd -daemon everytime
it started. I got better at the syntax of Erlang, so programming in erlang
was easier this time.

Lateness
========
Sorry, again, to submit this homework late. I did have much time during the
previous week, coming back from interviews from CMU. I did bring my laptop,
worked at the airport while waiting for my flight, worked on the plane when
it was above 10,000 feet, worked from the phone once the computer battery ran out,
both on the way there and on the way back. When I came back I also had a thesis
presentation so there were many things happening.
